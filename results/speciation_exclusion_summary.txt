Speciation Analysis Summary
==================================================

Metals with variable speciation fractions: As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, CrVI, CrIII, Hg(0)

Excluded metals (constant fractions): Hg(II), Hg(I)

Exclusion reasons:
- Very low concentrations (often < DL)
- Non-detect values replaced with DL/2
- Limited variation in water chemistry
- This is expected for trace metals

Recommendation: Focus risk assessment on metals with variable fractions
